# Identity and Access Management in a Microservice Architecture

A microservice architecture consists of many independent processes that need to communicate with each other. To protect the data that these microservices expose, it is essential to know who the caller is and what he is allowed to do. Establishing identity throughout this vast array of processes is a challenging task. This talk stresses the importance of identity federation and delegation in the microservice security world. It motivates the consumption of bearer tokens in all microservices, notably in the form JSON Web Tokens as the modern standard to transfer identity information and access grants. And it highlights an approach by layering OpenID Connect on top of OAuth2, providing an architecture where everything is standardized, self-contained and extensible - even across trust boundaries.

### Definitions

OAuth2 is a protocol for delegated authorization, defining how a client can receive the required tokens from a consenting user for further API access. OpenID Connect makes OAuth2 identity aware, enabling federation capabilities and user information sharing.
