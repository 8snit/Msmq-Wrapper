# Identity and Access Management in a Microservice Architecture

A Microservice Architecture consists of many independent services. While not all of them must be externally accessible, most of them are interconnected to exchange information. This service-to-service communication exposes the system to vulnerabilities and latency. The answer to questions like 'Where to put security barriers?' and 'How to pass identity and access information around?' has huge impact on the efficiency and scalability of the entire system. This talk outlines an approach by layering OpenID Connect on top of OAuth2 using JSON Web Tokens, providing a distributed authentication mechanism where everything is standardized, self-contained and easy to replicate.

Note: this talk has still not been accepted - presentation slides and demo code to come!
